# Strobach_and_Bel_2020

This repository includes scripts I used to anlyze and plot the results from this paper:

Strobach, E., and G. Bel. "Learning algorithms allow for improved reliability and accuracy of global mean surface temperature projections", Nature Communications 11, 451 (2020). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-14342-9

Global temperature time series from NCEP renalysis and CMIP5 are also inside.
